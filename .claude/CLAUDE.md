# User-Level Instructions for Claude

These instructions apply to all Claude sessions for user Steve.

## Communication Preferences
- Never use emojis in responses
- Be concise and direct

## Instruction Handling
- When asked to "remember" something, immediately persist it by updating this file or appropriate settings
- No mental notes - always take action to persist information
- Assume "remember" means user-level persistence unless specified otherwise

## Important Notes
- These are user-level preferences that should persist across all Claude sessions
- Project-specific instructions in project CLAUDE.md files take precedence over these
- Only use `rm` in git directories. Otherwise, use `trash`
- Use context7 mcp and other available docs when possible
